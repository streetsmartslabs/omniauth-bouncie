# OmniAuth::Bouncie

This is the unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Bouncie. Register your app and see official documentation at [https://docs.bouncie.dev](https://docs.bouncie.dev).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-bouncie'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-bouncie

## Usage

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :bouncie,
           ENV['BOUNCIE_CLIENT_ID'],
           ENV['BOUNCIE_CLIENT_SECRET'],
           token_params: {
             redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/bouncie/callback'
           }
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
